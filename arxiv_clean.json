    "title": "Are Video Models Ready as Zero-Shot Reasoners? An Empirical Study with   the MME-CoF Benchmark",
    "abstract": ":Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study, we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

    "abstract": ":As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal, self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase. The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions traces.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Defeating the Training-Inference Mismatch via FP16",
    "abstract": ":Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we demonstrate that simply reverting to \\textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16 uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL fine-tuning.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "AMO-Bench: Large Language Models Still Struggle in High School Math   Competitions",
    "abstract": ":We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems. Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50 problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization. Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%. Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into advancing the reasoning abilities of language models. this https URL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Deep sequence models tend to memorize geometrically; it is unclear why",
    "abstract": ":In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\nFrom this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\nThen, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Shahriar Noroozizadeh [view email][v1] Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:40:22 UTC (16,391 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems. Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation, as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization to improve model alignment to human values.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":The \"end-to-end\" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a novel architecture that enables truly \"end-to-end\" generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.\nThrough extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from \"hacking the test set\"-a practical upper bound for any static method. Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g., \"generate with low randomness\") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive LLM decoding.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR) transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical delta rule.\nWe pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output lengths.\nTo support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model checkpoints.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs, without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7% improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks. SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured, query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9 overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provide insights for enhancing their reliability.

To address this, speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous generation and validation of multiple tokens.

Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods.

However, its application is often hindered by low \\textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards.

This paper introduce \\textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \\textbf{Subproblem decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards, thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \\textbf{Failure-guided hints}: injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the probability of successful outcomes. 3) \\textbf{Dual-agent refinement}: employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration cost and increasing the overall reward density.

    "abstract": ":This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3 tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches have significantly advanced performance on this task.\nIn this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set, conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the input's vector representation.\nThrough a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities. These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze. Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured, lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in noisy nodes.

The highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78). The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76). Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3 Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522 (0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).\nConclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Rethinking Text-to-SQL: Dynamic Multi-turn SQL Interaction for   Real-world Database Exploration",
    "abstract": ":Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static, single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation. Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database. The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change. DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling 1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty.

    "title": "Context Engineering 2.0: The Context of Context Engineering",
    "abstract": ":Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well. Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering, provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Bayesian Network Fusion of Large Language Models for Sentiment Analysis",
    "abstract": ":Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune, require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs, underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Counteracting Matthew Effect in Self-Improvement of LVLMs through   Head-Tail Re-balancing",
    "abstract": ":Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations, this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew effect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CV\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "SecureReviewer: Enhancing Large Language Models for Secure Code Review   through Secure-aware Fine-tuning",
    "abstract": ":Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase. To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored. Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.SE\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models (7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results.

    "title": "Nexus: Execution-Grounded Multi-Agent Test Oracle Synthesis",
    "abstract": ":Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement. During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity. This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs. The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and 20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education. Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro surpassed 60\\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\\%.

    "abstract": ":While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method constructs a \"language model graph\" that maps relationships between models from the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM teams.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples, which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited computational resources.

    "title": "From Amateur to Master: Infusing Knowledge into LLMs via Automated   Curriculum Learning",
    "abstract": ":Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep, principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content and cognitive dimensions.\nExperiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points, while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing critical domain gaps in LLMs.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

While its capacity for information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic, interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird, and this http URL. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction.

    "abstract": ":Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs' architectures.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Do LLMs Signal When They're Right? Evidence from Neuron Agreement",
    "abstract": ":Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1) external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics; (2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of `correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom, covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in practice.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CR\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate accuracy alone does not reveal.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Peerat Limkonchotiwat [view email][v1] Thu, 30 Oct 2025 08:56:06 UTC (27,294 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages. Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

This study demonstrates that providing language models with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation. Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\\% higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in larger models compared to the baseline.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans. Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g., free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition) that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

However, many real-world applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG -- which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10 most cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k extraction.

    "abstract": ":Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g., length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders. WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7 datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer, and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them. WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance. They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Don't Let It Fade: Preserving Edits in Diffusion Language Models via   Token Timestep Allocation",
    "abstract": ":While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps, erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0). Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving stable and controllable diffusion text generation.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template, overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess instruction robustness.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy, exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility. SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Hitomi Jin Ling Tee [view email][v1] Thu, 30 Oct 2025 06:57:07 UTC (314 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.SD\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "MossNet: Mixture of State-Space Experts is a Multi-Head Attention",
    "abstract": ":Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple \"attention heads.\" Extensive experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens, further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition, real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model checkpoints to facilitate future research.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic, requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks. Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs) and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10 different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast, Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation, Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of effective communication.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common \"one problem, one solution\" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we propose a \"one problem, multiple solutions\" (1PNS) training paradigm that exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16 over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that 1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS.

    "abstract": ":Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic. However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3 reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation API to support further research.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

This paper introduces the Open Recommendation Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models. ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard. Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco, featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages. ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12 representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets, with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT benchmark, leaderboard, and codebase are available at this https URL.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Do Students Debias Like Teachers? On the Distillability of Bias   Mitigation Methods",
    "abstract": ":Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing'' capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments, we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale. Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better debiasing methods.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings, our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1 model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer models.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CR\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Analysis of Radiology Reports:   Epidemiology and Consequences of Incidental Thyroid Findings",
    "abstract": ":Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9% women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis, biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small, low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective follow-up.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Oscar Ponce-Ponte [view email][v1] Thu, 30 Oct 2025 00:15:07 UTC (1,000 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Rethinking Cross-lingual Alignment: Balancing Transfer and Cultural   Erasure in Multilingual LLMs",
    "abstract": ":Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational convergence can inadvertently cause \"cultural erasure\", the functional loss of providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure. Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the limitations of current alignment techniques.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets, enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step, tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However, these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine, thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer. Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies, failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies. In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description, explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations, their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Syrielle Montariol [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 22:34:26 UTC (19,134 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise   Reasoning",
    "abstract": ":Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical \"actions\". SRL trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of",

    "abstract": ":Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and trustworthy AI in formal domains.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Sina Bagheri Nezhad [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 21:17:57 UTC (817 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation, particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in downstream applications.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality. Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research, comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all metrics, except for annotation time.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Tiago Timponi Torrent [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 19:13:48 UTC (10,743 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge, as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity, bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications, such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.AI\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks: (1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM raters.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.AI\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust. Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks, annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and 14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards. Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art frontier models.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams, sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature, quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams.

    "abstract": ":Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding. Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and guiding development toward more effective interactions.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Zejiang Shen [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 17:47:18 UTC (3,364 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:54:45 UTC (3,372 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to 13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive framing.

    "title": "The Tool Decathlon: Benchmarking Language Agents for Diverse, Realistic,   and Long-Horizon Task Execution",
    "abstract": ":Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604 tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Interpreting LLMs as Credit Risk Classifiers: Do Their Feature   Explanations Align with Classical ML?",
    "abstract": ":Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP, and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits, baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "A Survey on Efficient Large Language Model Training: From Data-centric   Perspectives",
    "abstract": ":Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection, data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in large-scale model training.

    "abstract": ":Large language model-based agents show promise for software engineering, but environment configuration remains a bottleneck due to heavy manual effort and scarce large-scale, high-quality datasets. Existing benchmarks assess only end-to-end build/test success, obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail. We introduce the Environment Configuration Diagnosis Benchmark, Enconda-bench, which provides process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent capabilities during environment setup-planning, perception-driven error diagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and action to execute final environment configuration. Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting realistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality evaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end executability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates. Evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while agents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective corrections, limiting end-to-end performance. To our knowledge, Enconda-bench is the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment for environment configuration, offering actionable insights for improving software engineering agents.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.SE\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly. We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples, forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines.

    "abstract": ":ZK-SenseLM is a secure and auditable wireless sensing framework that pairs a large-model encoder for Wi-Fi channel state information (and optionally mmWave radar or RFID) with a policy-grounded decision layer and end-to-end zero-knowledge proofs of inference. The encoder uses masked spectral pretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal alignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens. To reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated selective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is registered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving pipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version binding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the quantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and confidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a gateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates with differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization without weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are part of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion, respiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1 and calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and rejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64 encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR) method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from 10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a 58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78 percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing. The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and computational efficiency are critical.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Tarun Kumar Chawdhury [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:41:44 UTC (2,611 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "EHR-R1: A Reasoning-Enhanced Foundational Language Model for Electronic   Health Record Analysis",
    "abstract": ":Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap, specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis. Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning 42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and achieving a 10\\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins, EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities, yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency. While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and programming, its value in argumentative domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level (Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when applied across different roles.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Daniele Giofré [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:27:47 UTC (16,261 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:49:22 UTC (16,262 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "FARSIQA: Faithful and Advanced RAG System for Islamic Question Answering",
    "abstract": ":The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex, multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries, progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable 97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Mohammad Aghajani Asl [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:25:34 UTC (940 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Communication and Verification in LLM Agents towards Collaboration under   Information Asymmetry",
    "abstract": ":While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities. Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration in AI systems. this https URL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Lost in Phonation: Voice Quality Variation as an Evaluation Dimension   for Speech Foundation Models",
    "abstract": ":Recent advances in speech foundation models (SFMs) have enabled the direct processing of spoken language from raw audio, bypassing intermediate textual representations. This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially respond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal. One under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality, encompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation types are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and social meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely rely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to failure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic features influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through open-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether model behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce a new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality, designed to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice. Our work provides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to these particular non-lexical aspects of speech perception.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.AS\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Hybrid Quantum-Classical Recurrent Neural Networks",
    "abstract": ":We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially large Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction, making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints. At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory, and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise) grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However, current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona (public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human baseline.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Bangde Du [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:00:42 UTC (1,867 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 30 Oct 2025 11:19:24 UTC (1,867 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains. The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge management and security operations.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Grounded in Reality: Learning and Deploying Proactive LLM from Offline   Logs",
    "abstract": ":Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators, creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \\textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \\textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense, turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy, decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action, state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially, \\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations, our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts, proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible, real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented LLM applications.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches that rely on independent generations.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Eshika Khandelwal [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 12:06:42 UTC (15,998 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions: paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception; however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy, thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving transparency and reliability.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for formal mathematics.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore, implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models. Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction more natural and contextually grounded.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering, annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted, slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

We propose a new LLM serving system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this problem.

We describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling scheme.

Existing benchmarks are largely Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains: Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law, International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science, and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge with bilingual understanding.

    "abstract": ":The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for mental health support.

    "abstract": ":Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology. In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological convergence.\nOur approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend analysis of topic co-occurence.\nWe validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text analysis.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Alexander Sternfeld [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 10:41:03 UTC (1,872 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Results show that instruction tuning yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused adaptation and broad linguistic generalization.

Recent scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models (LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the conclusions produced by generative AI.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Abhishek Purushothama [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 10:21:25 UTC (1,956 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

A prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization, especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for real-world applications.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "GAP: Graph-Based Agent Planning with Parallel Tool Use and Reinforcement   Learning",
    "abstract": ":Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However, existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution, failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

    "abstract": ":Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought (P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs) to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +2",

    "abstract": ":Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and tasks.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR) construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502 synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree, supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards. Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length, token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together. Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster, better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the generic baseline (10.65\\% vs 7.01\\%) while being 77\\% faster in response (15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous, theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially intelligent agents.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts. Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model \"views\" input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task, which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

However, a significant portion of readily available long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient, making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining. LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings, thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential. Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones. Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes problem-specific strategies in reasoning.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.AI\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that redefines how models interact with documents.\nWe introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for reasoning.\nAs an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Hongjin Qian [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 04:29:17 UTC (517 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 30 Oct 2025 08:52:17 UTC (517 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Building on existing works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance. Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set. Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both seen and unseen acoustic conditions.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Metis-SPECS: Decoupling Multimodal Learning via Self-distilled   Preference-based Cold Start",
    "abstract": ":Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a wave of \"MLLM-r1\" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However, SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting, weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation; (2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow, transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%. Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing in-distribution \"stuckness,\" improving exploration, stabilizing training, and raising the performance ceiling.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective   Selection",
    "abstract": ":Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric), while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "MemEIC: A Step Toward Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing",
    "abstract": ":The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates, potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the \"right to be forgotten\", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180 papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Pretraining Strategies using Monolingual and Parallel Data for   Low-Resource Machine Translation",
    "abstract": ":This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages, including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented populations.

    "abstract": ":Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107 controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics. We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically simulating human-like social dynamics.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Yun-Shiuan Chuang [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 02:21:10 UTC (1,167 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs) iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries, and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision, which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling. Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1 achieves up to an 1",

In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs) for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity. Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements, partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5 achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively, highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CV\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "TOPol: Capturing and Explaining Multidimensional Semantic Polarity   Fields and Vectors",
    "abstract": ":Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity), a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL) defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors, the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and (ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable, generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive multidimensional discourse analysis.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners. Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own reasoning process.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "GAPMAP: Mapping Scientific Knowledge Gaps in Biomedical Literature Using   Large Language Models",
    "abstract": ":Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2) under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of implicit gaps inference, we introduce \\textbf{\\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps. This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment, including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking across open- and closed-weight models.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Evaluating Emotion Recognition in Spoken Language Models on Emotionally   Incongruent Speech",
    "abstract": ":Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples, a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Paula Costa Prof [view email][v1] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:45:36 UTC (133 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 30 Oct 2025 01:34:58 UTC (133 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "StorageXTuner: An LLM Agent-Driven Automatic Tuning Framework for   Heterogeneous Storage Systems",
    "abstract": ":Automatically configuring storage systems is hard: parameter spaces are large and conditions vary across workloads, deployments, and versions. Heuristic and ML tuners are often system specific, require manual glue, and degrade under changes. Recent LLM-based approaches help but usually treat tuning as a single-shot, system-specific task, which limits cross-system reuse, constrains exploration, and weakens validation. We present StorageXTuner, an LLM agent-driven auto-tuning framework for heterogeneous storage engines. StorageXTuner separates concerns across four agents - Executor (sandboxed benchmarking), Extractor (performance digest), Searcher (insight-guided configuration exploration), and Reflector (insight generation and management). The design couples an insight-driven tree search with layered memory that promotes empirically validated insights and employs lightweight checkers to guard against unsafe actions. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on RocksDB, LevelDB, CacheLib, and MySQL InnoDB with YCSB, MixGraph, and TPC-H/C. Relative to out-of-the-box settings and to ELMo-Tune, StorageXTuner reaches up to 575% and 111% higher throughput, reduces p99 latency by as much as 88% and 56%, and converges with fewer trials.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.DB\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models (LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis, and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution. Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar performance by composing information across layers through query-value interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular, matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated, or even nonsensical prompts.\nOn the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning guarantees.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Based on our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word, and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory irrespective of model details.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector - Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the internal organization of multimodal representations.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "SemCoT: Accelerating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through   Semantically-Aligned Implicit Tokens",
    "abstract": ":The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed ``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components. However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1) they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning (when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning, resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge, we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and effectiveness.

    "abstract": ":Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically, we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and the specific generalizations learned by language models.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737 challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and 63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development of more robust and reliable language models.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

We further propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay the groundwork for future progress.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Seeing Through the MiRAGE: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented   Generation",
    "abstract": ":We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess multimodal RAG.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Alexander Martin [view email][v1] Tue, 28 Oct 2025 18:21:19 UTC (9,688 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Do Large Language Models Grasp The Grammar? Evidence from   Grammar-Book-Guided Probing in Luxembourgish",
    "abstract": ":Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages. Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages, and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":In this paper, we present our submissions to the unified WMT25 Translation Evaluation Shared Task. For the Quality Score Prediction subtask, we create a new generation of MetricX with improvements in the input format and the training protocol, while for the Error Span Detection subtask we develop a new model, GemSpanEval, trained to predict error spans along with their severities and categories. Both systems are based on the state-of-the-art multilingual open-weights model Gemma 3, fine-tuned on publicly available WMT data. We demonstrate that MetricX-25, adapting Gemma 3 to an encoder-only architecture with a regression head on top, can be trained to effectively predict both MQM and ESA quality scores, and significantly outperforms its predecessor. Our decoder-only GemSpanEval model, on the other hand, we show to be competitive in error span detection with xCOMET, a strong encoder-only sequence-tagging baseline. With error span detection formulated as a generative task, we instruct the model to also output the context for each predicted error span, thus ensuring that error spans are identified unambiguously.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Public research results on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents remain relatively rare, since the collection of agent training data presents unique challenges. In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves as an \"interlingua\" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding, software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments, we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Parallel thinking expands exploration breadth, complementing the deep exploration of information-seeking (IS) agents to further enhance problem-solving capability. However, conventional parallel thinking faces two key challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from scratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories during answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full consideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final answer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks demonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in exploratory token consumption.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "AgentFold: Long-Horizon Web Agents with Proactive Context Management",
    "abstract": ":LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like OpenAI's o4-mini.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a transformative approach for open-ended problem solving, with information seeking (IS) being a core capability that enables autonomous reasoning and decision-making. While prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic, Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp, GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over strong baselines.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. We introduce a data synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality, multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative \"near-miss\" samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to effectively learn from these \"near-misses\". Experiments on diverse question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls, demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search agents.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Through adversarial dynamics, the Challenger creates an automatic curriculum at the frontier of the Reasoner's capability, while corpus grounding provides the rich, near-inexhaustible external signal necessary for sustained improvement. Unlike existing ungrounded self-play methods that offer more limited benefits, SPICE achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning (+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families.

    "abstract": ":Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical decision support systems, particularly in the\ncontext of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),\ninstructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students, residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied\nprofessional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This\nstudy introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,\nrole-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style. We test this framework on three medical QA\ndatasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our\nresults demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they\nprimarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation\nacross clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform\nacross roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the cognitive complexity found in real-world medical\npractice.

    "abstract": ":In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34% higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by 7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

To address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning, R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical, requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":We ask where, and under what conditions, dyslexic reading costs arise in a large-scale naturalistic reading dataset. Using eye-tracking aligned to word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability), we model how each feature influences dyslexic time costs. We find that all three features robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. In short, we quantify when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and offer actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for dyslexics.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Hugo Rydel - Johnston W [view email][v1] Tue, 28 Oct 2025 17:15:31 UTC (787 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Reward models (RMs) have become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), serving as scalable proxies for human evaluation in both training and inference. However, existing RMs struggle on knowledge-intensive and long-form tasks, where evaluating correctness requires grounding beyond the model's internal knowledge. This limitation hinders them from reliably discriminating subtle quality differences, especially when external evidence is necessary. To address this, we introduce OpenRM, a tool-augmented long-form reward model that systematically judges open-ended responses by invoking external tools to gather relevant evidence. We train OpenRM with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on over 27K synthesized pairwise examples generated through a controllable data synthesis framework. The training objective jointly supervises intermediate tool usage and final outcome accuracy, incentivizing our reward model to learn effective evidence-based judgment strategies. Extensive experiments on three newly-collected datasets and two widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward modeling approaches. As a further step, we integrate OpenRM into both inference-time response selection and training-time data selection. This yields consistent gains in downstream LLM alignment tasks, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented reward models for scaling reliable long-form evaluation.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Ziyou Hu [view email][v1] Tue, 28 Oct 2025 17:02:46 UTC (5,998 KB)\n[v2] Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:06:18 UTC (5,993 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Maintaining mutual understanding is a key component in human-human conversation to avoid conversation breakdowns, in which repair, particularly Other-Initiated Repair (OIR, when one speaker signals trouble and prompts the other to resolve), plays a vital role. However, Conversational Agents (CAs) still fail to recognize user repair initiation, leading to breakdowns or disengagement. This work proposes a multimodal model to automatically detect repair initiation in Dutch dialogues by integrating linguistic and prosodic features grounded in Conversation Analysis. The results show that prosodic cues complement linguistic features and significantly improve the results of pretrained text and audio embeddings, offering insights into how different features interact. Future directions include incorporating visual cues, exploring multilingual and cross-context corpora to assess the robustness and generalizability.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Relative Scaling Laws for LLMs",
    "abstract": ":Scaling laws describe how language models improve with additional data, parameters, and compute. While widely used, they are typically measured on aggregate test sets. Aggregate evaluations yield clean trends but average over heterogeneous subpopulations, obscuring performance disparities. We introduce relative scaling laws, which track how performance gaps between test distributions evolve with scale rather than focusing solely on absolute error. Using 255 decoder-only Transformers trained under matched-compute (IsoFLOP) budgets from $10^{18}$--$10^{20}$ FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, we find diverse trajectories: academic domains on MMLU converge toward parity; regional English dialects shift depending on population size; and clusters of AI risk behaviours split, with capability- and influence-related risks increasing during pretraining while adversarial risks do not. These results show that although scaling improves overall performance, it is not a universal equalizer. To support further study, we release all model checkpoints from this work to enable practitioners to measure relative alongside traditional scaling laws, in order to better prioritize robustness challenges in light of the bitter lesson.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

However, adapting these decoder-only LLMs to new tasks across languages remains challenging. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are widely used, prefix-based techniques such as soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and Llama Adapter are less explored, especially for zero-shot transfer in decoder-only models. We present a comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as the impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B.

    "title": "Long-Context Modeling with Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention for   On-Device LLMs",
    "abstract": ":The quadratic cost of attention hinders the scalability of long-context LLMs, especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing static sparse methods such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention (DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device LLMs.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have exhibited substantial potential for parallel text generation, which may enable more efficient generation compared to autoregressive models. However, current dLLMs suffer from fixed generation lengths, which indicates the generation lengths of dLLMs have to be determined before decoding as a hyper-parameter, leading to issues in efficiency and flexibility. To solve these problems, in this work, we propose to train a diffusion LLM with native variable generation lengths, abbreviated as dLLM-Var. Concretely, we aim to train a model to accurately predict the [EOS] token in the generated text, which makes a dLLM be able to natively infer in a block diffusion manner, while still maintaining the ability of global bi-directional (full) attention and high parallelism. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a 30.1x speedup over traditional dLLM inference paradigms and a 2.4x speedup relative to autoregressive models such as Qwen and Llama. Our method achieves higher accuracy and faster inference, elevating dLLMs beyond mere academic novelty and supporting their practical use in real-world applications.

    "title": "ReForm: Reflective Autoformalization with Prospective Bounded Sequence   Optimization",
    "abstract": ":Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm achieves an average improvement of 22.6 percentage points over the strongest baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Guoxin Chen [view email][v1] Tue, 28 Oct 2025 16:22:54 UTC (3,024 KB)\n[v2] Thu, 30 Oct 2025 11:15:27 UTC (3,024 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants, and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows. However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under 20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale, expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific research.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nChange to browse by:\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Unlike traditional self-supervised learning methods, BEARD uniquely combines a BEST-RQ objective with knowledge distillation from a frozen teacher encoder, ensuring the encoder's complementarity with the pre-trained decoder. Our experiments focus on the ATCO2 corpus from the challenging Air Traffic Control (ATC) communications domain, characterized by non-native speech, noise, and specialized phraseology. Using about 5,000 hours of untranscribed speech for BEARD and 2 hours of transcribed speech for fine-tuning, the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous baseline and fine-tuned model, achieving a relative improvement of 12% compared to the fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use a self-supervised learning objective for domain adaptation of Whisper.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":The history of the Korean language is characterized by a discrepancy between its spoken and written forms and a pivotal shift from Chinese characters to the Hangul alphabet. However, this linguistic evolution has remained largely unexplored in NLP due to a lack of accessible historical corpora. To address this gap, we introduce the Open Korean Historical Corpus, a large-scale, openly licensed dataset spanning 1,300 years and 6 languages, as well as under-represented writing systems like Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and Hanja-Hangul mixed script. This corpus contains 18 million documents and 5 billion tokens from 19 sources, ranging from the 7th century to 2025. We leverage this resource to quantitatively analyze major linguistic shifts: (1) Idu usage peaked in the 1860s before declining sharply; (2) the transition from Hanja to Hangul was a rapid transformation starting around 1890; and (3) North Korea's lexical divergence causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51 times higher out-of-vocabulary rates. This work provides a foundational resource for quantitative diachronic analysis by capturing the history of the Korean language. Moreover, it can serve as a pre-training corpus for large language models, potentially improving their understanding of Sino-Korean vocabulary in modern Hangul as well as archaic writing systems.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Levée d'ambiguïtés par grammaires locales",
    "abstract": ":Many words are ambiguous in terms of their part of speech (POS). However, when a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced. Disambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS associated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging. The problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language processing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking, expression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc. Lexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural language processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce multiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct solution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence rate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is unrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a lexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate and implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal description of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation grammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer paths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a combination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by considering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling of a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come spontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often due to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is targeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed specification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be necessary.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Parallel Loop Transformer for Efficient Test-Time Computation Scaling",
    "abstract": ":Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or \"loops.\" However, this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop. This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques. First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache) from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Latent Sketchpad: Sketching Visual Thoughts to Elicit Multimodal   Reasoning in MLLMs",
    "abstract": ":While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this, we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone. It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and broader applications.

    "abstract": ":Accurate confidence calibration in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for safe use in high-stakes domains, where clear verbalized confidence enhances user trust. Traditional methods that mimic reference confidence expressions often fail to capture the reasoning needed for accurate confidence assessment. We propose natural language critiques as a solution, ideally suited for confidence calibration, as precise gold confidence labels are hard to obtain and often require multiple generations. This paper studies how natural language critiques can enhance verbalized confidence, addressing: (1) What to critique: uncertainty (question-focused) or confidence (answer-specific)? Analysis shows confidence suits multiple-choice tasks, while uncertainty excels in open-ended scenarios. (2) How to critique: self-critique or critique calibration training? We propose Self-Critique, enabling LLMs to critique and optimize their confidence beyond mere accuracy, and CritiCal, a novel Critique Calibration training method that leverages natural language critiques to improve confidence calibration, moving beyond direct numerical optimization. Experiments show that CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other competitive baselines, even surpassing its teacher model, GPT-4o, in complex reasoning tasks. CritiCal also shows robust generalization in out-of-distribution settings, advancing LLM's reliability.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":As Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our lives, their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern. Detecting and evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible language technologies.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Katherine Elizabeth Abramski [view email][v1] Tue, 28 Oct 2025 15:03:18 UTC (2,962 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Scientific talks are a growing medium for disseminating research, and automatically identifying relevant literature that grounds or enriches a talk would be highly valuable for researchers and students alike. We introduce Reference Prediction from Talks (RPT), a new task that maps long, and unstructured scientific presentations to relevant papers. To support research on RPT, we present Talk2Ref, the first large-scale dataset of its kind, containing 6,279 talks and 43,429 cited papers (26 per talk on average), where relevance is approximated by the papers cited in the talk's corresponding source publication. We establish strong baselines by evaluating state-of-the-art text embedding models in zero-shot retrieval scenarios, and propose a dual-encoder architecture trained on Talk2Ref. We further explore strategies for handling long transcripts, as well as training for domain adaptation. Our results show that fine-tuning on Talk2Ref significantly improves citation prediction performance, demonstrating both the challenges of the task and the effectiveness of our dataset for learning semantic representations from spoken scientific content. The dataset and trained models are released under an open license to foster future research on integrating spoken scientific communication into citation recommendation systems.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Hallucination remains one of the key obstacles to the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs), particularly in real-world applications. Among various mitigation strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and reasoning enhancement have emerged as two of the most effective and widely adopted approaches, marking a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to balancing creativity and reliability. However, their synergistic potential and underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. We propose a taxonomy distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically examine how RAG and reasoning address each, and present a unified framework supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus. Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp, Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5 refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and model-agnostic.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in vision-language tasks such as reasoning segmentation, where models generate segmentation masks based on textual queries. While prior work has primarily focused on perturbing image inputs, semantically equivalent textual paraphrases-crucial in real-world applications where users express the same intent in varied ways-remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel adversarial paraphrasing task: generating grammatically correct paraphrases that preserve the original query meaning while degrading segmentation performance. To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases, we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models. We reveal that they remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing-even under strict semantic and grammatical constraints.

Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico, an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.AI\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":The effectiveness of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is often limited in low-resource linguistic settings due to a lack of high-quality training data. We introduce LuxIT, a novel, monolingual instruction tuning dataset for Luxembourgish developed to mitigate this challenge. We synthesize the dataset from a corpus of native Luxembourgish texts, utilizing DeepSeek-R1-0528, chosen for its shown proficiency in Luxembourgish. Following generation, we apply a quality assurance process, employing an LLM-as-a-judge approach. To investigate the practical utility of the dataset, we fine-tune several smaller-scale LLMs on LuxIT. Subsequent benchmarking against their base models on Luxembourgish language proficiency examinations, however, yields mixed results, with performance varying significantly across different models. LuxIT represents a critical contribution to Luxembourgish natural language processing and offers a replicable monolingual methodology, though our findings highlight the need for further research to optimize its application.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "SynthWorlds: Controlled Parallel Worlds for Disentangling Reasoning and   Knowledge in Language Models",
    "abstract": ":Evaluating the reasoning ability of language models (LMs) is complicated by their extensive parametric world knowledge, where benchmark performance often reflects factual recall rather than genuine reasoning. Existing datasets and approaches (e.g., temporal filtering, paraphrasing, adversarial substitution) cannot cleanly separate the two. We present SynthWorlds, a framework that disentangles task reasoning complexity from factual knowledge. In SynthWorlds, we construct parallel corpora representing two worlds with identical interconnected structure: a real-mapped world, where models may exploit parametric knowledge, and a synthetic-mapped world, where such knowledge is meaningless. On top of these corpora, we design two mirrored tasks as case studies: multi-hop question answering and page navigation, which maintain equal reasoning difficulty across worlds. Experiments in parametric-only (e.g., closed-book QA) and knowledge-augmented (e.g., retrieval-augmented) LM settings reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap, defined as the performance boost models gain from memorized parametric world knowledge. Knowledge acquisition and integration mechanisms reduce but do not eliminate this gap, highlighting opportunities for system improvements. Fully automatic and scalable, SynthWorlds provides a controlled environment for evaluating LMs in ways that were previously challenging, enabling precise and testable comparisons of reasoning and memorization.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Recent efforts leverage knowledge distillation techniques to develop lightweight and practical sentiment analysis models. These methods are grounded in human-written instructions and large-scale user texts. Despite the promising results, two key challenges remain: (1) manually written instructions are limited in diversity and quantity, making them insufficient to ensure comprehensive coverage of distilled knowledge; (2) large-scale user texts incur high computational cost, hindering the practicality of these methods. To this end, we introduce COMPEFFDIST, a comprehensive and efficient distillation framework for sentiment analysis. Our framework consists of two key modules: attribute-based automatic instruction construction and difficulty-based data filtering, which correspondingly tackle the aforementioned challenges. Applying our method across multiple model series (Llama-3, Qwen-3, and Gemma-3), we enable 3B student models to match the performance of 20x larger teacher models on most tasks. In addition, our approach greatly outperforms baseline methods in data efficiency, attaining the same performance level with only 10% of the data.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.AI\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT). Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue. Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to negligible latency overhead.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our transformation to an unseen simplification dataset (MedEASI), as well as datasets from languages outside the training data (ES,DE).

Based on this approach, we introduce PRDBench, a novel benchmark comprising 50 real-world Python projects across 20 domains, each with structured Product Requirement Document (PRD) requirements, comprehensive evaluation criteria, and reference implementations. PRDBench features rich data sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of various test types beyond unit tests. Extensive experiments on PRDBench demonstrate its effectiveness in assessing the capabilities of both code agents and evaluation agents, providing a scalable and robust framework for annotation and evaluation.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Existing benchmarks for long-form generation typically assess real-world queries with hard-to-verify metrics or use synthetic setups that ease evaluation but overlook real-world intricacies. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{LongWeave}, which balances real-world and verifiable assessment with Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval). CoV-Eval constructs tasks by first defining verifiable targets within real-world scenarios, then systematically generating corresponding queries, textual materials, and constraints based on these targets. This ensures that tasks are both realistic and objectively assessable, enabling rigorous assessment of model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints. LongWeave supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven distinct tasks. Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world complexity and output length increase.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": ":Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer everyday questions, yet their performance on culturally grounded and dialectal content remains uneven across languages. We propose a comprehensive method that (i) translates Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) multiple-choice questions (MCQs) into English and several Arabic dialects, (ii) converts them into open-ended questions (OEQs), (iii) benchmarks a range of zero-shot and fine-tuned LLMs under both MCQ and OEQ settings, and (iv) generates chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales to fine-tune models for step-by-step reasoning. Using this method, we extend an existing dataset in which QAs are parallelly aligned across multiple language varieties, making it, to our knowledge, the first of its kind. We conduct extensive experiments with both open and closed models. Our findings show that (i) models underperform on Arabic dialects, revealing persistent gaps in culturally grounded and dialect-specific knowledge; (ii) Arabic-centric models perform well on MCQs but struggle with OEQs; and (iii) CoT improves judged correctness while yielding mixed n-gram-based metrics.

    "title": "Critique-RL: Training Language Models for Critiquing through Two-Stage   Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": ":Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains. To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a 5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts for Enhanced Trajectory-Level Exploration   in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards",
    "abstract": ":Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly with algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has proven highly effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, a critical bottleneck in current pipelines lies in the limited diversity of sampled trajectories during group rollouts. Homogeneous trajectories and their associated rewards would diminish the return signals for policy updates, thereby hindering effective policy learning. This lack of diversity stems primarily from token-level stochastic sampling, where local variations are likely to collapse into near-identical reasoning paths. To address this limitation, we propose Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR), a novel rollout strategy designed to explicitly promotes trajectory-level diversity by enforcing branching into different candidate tokens likely to yield distinct continuations. Specifically, LATR iteratively operates in three stages: (1) branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, (2) performing lookahead simulation for each new branch, and (3) pruning branches that exhibits prolonged similarity during simulation. Compared with stochastic Sampling, LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithms across different reasoning tasks.

    "title": "LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset",
    "abstract": ":Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance (LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299 labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on this https URL.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "MERGE: Minimal Expression-Replacement GEneralization Test for Natural   Language Inference",
    "abstract": ":In recent years, many generalization benchmarks have shown language models' lack of robustness in natural language inference (NLI). However, manually creating new benchmarks is costly, while automatically generating high-quality ones, even by modifying existing benchmarks, is extremely difficult. In this paper, we propose a methodology for automatically generating high-quality variants of original NLI problems by replacing open-class words, while crucially preserving their underlying reasoning. We dub our generalization test as MERGE (Minimal Expression-Replacements GEneralization), which evaluates the correctness of models' predictions across reasoning-preserving variants of the original problem. Our results show that NLI models' perform 4-20% worse on variants, suggesting low generalizability even on such minimally altered problems. We also analyse how word class of the replacements, word probability, and plausibility influence NLI models' performance.\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
